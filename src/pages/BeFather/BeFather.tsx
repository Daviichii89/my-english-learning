              Although I know that raising a child can be challenging and full of unexpected moments, I’m excited about the idea of sharing my values, stories and love with him/her.

                I imagine teaching my child how to ride a bike 🚲, playing videogames together 🎮, and exploring new places as a family. I'm eager to make unforgettable memories and support my child as he/she grows and learns about the world.
