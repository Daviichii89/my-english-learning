              One of the top items on my bucket list is to travel to Japan, because I have always been fascinated in their unique mix of tradition and technology.

              Since I was a child, I have been interested in Japanese culture, from anime and samurai history.

              Although the flight is long and the trip can be very expensive, I think it will be worth it.

              I would love to visit <b>Kyoto</b>, where I could walk through ancient temples and beautiful gardens. While I’m there, I also want to try authentic <b>ramen</b> 🍜 and <b>sushi</b> 🍣.

              Obviously, I want to visit the Super Nintendo World 😍.

              I hope to go during cherry blossom season, so that I can see the famous sakura trees in full bloom. Before I leave, I plan to buy a lot of souvenirs as a memory of the trip.
